    "description": "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a popular personality assessment tool that is designed to help individuals understand their unique psychological preferences in how they perceive the world and make decisions. The MBTI is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, which suggests that individuals have innate preferences for how they process information, make decisions, and interact with others. The MBTI assesses four dimensions of personality: Extraversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging vs. Perceiving, resulting in 16 possible personality types. The MBTI is often used in personal and professional development, team building, and career counseling.",
